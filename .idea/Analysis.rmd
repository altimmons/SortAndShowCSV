The code chunk appears:
```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse", "stringi", "stringr", "readr")
require(tidyverse)
require(stringi)
require(stringr)
require(readr)
```

Ok, its been a bit since I have done this.  Let's see if I can remember.
If the above fails, or doesn't do anything execute

`install.packages("tidyverse")`



Type any R code in the chunk, for example:
```{r}
print.noquote(getwd())

```
```{r}

```
